# Default Flask App
The New York Daily News' starter [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) app. Comes with flask plus tools for turning your flask app into flatfiles. Based on [The Denver Post's Bill Tracker flask app](https://github.com/denverpost/bill-tracker), which was based on [the Denver Crimes flask app](http://crime.denverpost.com/about/). 

## Usage

1. Check out the code,
2. Open up terminal, 
3. Create a virtualenv for your project (`pip install virtualenv` from anywhere in your terminal should work. [More here](http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/))
    1. To get set up with virtual environments (Mac and *nix):
        1. `pip install virtualenv` (if you get a "requirement already satisfied" response, that's okay, continue along)
        2. `pip install virtualenvwrapper` (if you get a "requirement already satisfied" response, that's okay too)
        3. `export WORKON_HOME=~/Envs` _* Note: It's worth adding this line to your `~/.bash_profile` file_
        4. `source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh` _* Note: It's worth adding this line to your `~/.bash_profile` file too_
        5. `cd path/to/your/repo`
        6. `mkvirtualenv REPONAME`
        7. Now back to the rest of the usage instructions below...
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt` from your terminal
5. `python runserver.py` gets you a webserver running on port 5000.
6. [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
